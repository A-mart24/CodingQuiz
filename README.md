MY TASK:
For this weeks homework I was tasked with creating a coding quiz game that would show off the skills
that I learned this week. This game has a built in timer that counts down as well as a penalty should 
the player get an answer incorrect. Users will also be able to have their initials and high scores saved at the end of the game.

User Story:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
